# Changelog

Notable changes between releases. Format roughly follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). The internal build order
used during development is captured here so the README can stay focused
on what the software does, not on what sprint shipped what.

## [Unreleased]

**A locally built Mac app could crash on the first PDF.** PyInstaller
collects two different HarfBuzz builds into one bundle — Pillow's private
copy and the Homebrew one Pango needs — and both answer to the same install
name, so whichever loads first wins for the whole process. When Pillow's
won, `libharfbuzz-subset` resolved against it and PDF rendering died in
native code. `packaging/macos/isolate_pillow_harfbuzz.py` gives Pillow's
copy a private install name and restores the public alias to the Homebrew
library; `packaging/macos/README.md` covers when to run it. Local builds
only — CI-built releases are unaffected.

### v2.11.1 — Wave imports work, and you can copy an API token

Both fixes in this release came from @rchanks, and both were found the way
we most want things found: against a real file and a real workflow.

**Importing from Wave brought in nothing and said it had worked.** Wave's
**Account Transactions** report — the plain export any Wave user can pull,
with no plan restrictions — failed on two independent faults at once.

`parse_gl()` looked for `Account Name`, `Debit Amount` and `Credit Amount`.
The report's real headers are `ACCOUNT NUMBER`, `DEBIT (In Business
Currency)` and `CREDIT (In Business Currency)`. None matched, so every row
parsed as an empty account with zero on both sides — and the dry run then
reported the file **balanced**, because zero equals zero. It failed once, on
a deduplicated message about an account named `''` that never changed no
matter how the source file was reshaped, because the parser had never read
the file's amounts or account names to begin with.

A dry run that passes because everything is zero is worse than one that
fails, and that lesson is not specific to Wave.

The second fault was the filename. The bundle classifier checked the
fragment `account` before `transaction`, and Wave's own export is named
`Account Transactions.csv` — so an unambiguously-ledger file was always
taken for the chart of accounts and collided with the real chart upload.
Ledger fragments are checked first now.

That reorder was measured rather than assumed. Across realistic export
filenames from the four sources that share the classifier, fourteen classify
identically and nine move, **eight of the nine from wrong to right** — so it
corrects files beyond Wave. The ninth, a chart of accounts named something
like `General Account List.csv`, would now be read as a ledger. That is
inherent to first-match-wins rather than to the new order, which is right far
more often than the old one, and it is recorded so the trade stays
deliberate.

Found while migrating a real business's several years of Wave history: a
six-year, 2000-transaction export that now imports with a zero-difference
trial balance.

**An API token is shown exactly once, and had to be copied by hand.** It sat
in a styled block with no button and no shortcut, so getting it meant
triple-clicking and hoping — which failed often enough that one person
recovered their token by screenshotting it. A secret ending up in a camera
roll is a security outcome, not an inconvenience. There is a Copy button now,
with a clear message to fall back on if the browser refuses.

### v2.11.0 — Record a credit from a supplier

**A supplier credit had nowhere correct to go.** Reported by
@CimarronSiteServices (issue #129) while evaluating SlowBooks against
QuickBooks Online. A vendor issues a credit for returned or short-shipped
materials; a bill with a negative line is refused, an expense with a
negative amount is refused, and both refusals point at credit memos — which
only accept a customer. The reporter went looking through bills, expenses,
credit memos, card charges and journal entries, and was right that none of
them was the answer.

**Vendor Credits are the missing document.** A bill posts DR Expense / CR
Accounts Payable; a vendor credit is its mirror. It reduces what you owe
that vendor the moment it is entered, and you apply it to a bill afterwards
— or leave it on the vendor's account until there is a bill to settle.
Applying posts nothing at all, because A/P already moved when the credit was
issued; applying only decides which bill it pays down.

The reporter also named why a manual journal entry against A/P was not good
enough, and he was right: a journal entry moves the general ledger without
moving the vendor sub-ledger, so A/P aging and the vendor's balance stop
agreeing with account 2000. That is the same split as #119, and it is why
this is a document rather than a shortcut.

**Returning stock takes it off the shelf.** A bill receives inventory into
the Inventory asset rather than an expense; a credit for returned goods
takes it back out of Inventory, records a `return_out` movement, and drops
the quantity on hand. Anything else would leave an asset on the balance
sheet for goods that are no longer in the building. A credit for an
inventory item with no asset account is refused rather than posted to an
expense — the same refusal `create_bill` already makes, for the same reason.

**Both aging reports were hiding credits, and now show them.** Found while
building this, and confirmed before it was fixed: an unapplied credit memo
credits A/R at the moment it is issued, but A/R aging summed only invoice
balances. A customer with a 1,000 invoice and a 300 credit showed a ledger
balance of 700 and an aging total of 1,000. The report overstated what
customers owed by every credit not yet applied, and the sub-ledger did not
tie to account 1100. The payable side would have inherited exactly the same
hole, so both are fixed together, and both reports now carry an
`unapplied_credits` column — because "you owe 700" and "you owe 1,000 and
hold a 300 credit" are different facts to someone about to pay a vendor.

`CONTROL` on the badge vocabulary: `.badge-issued` and `.badge-applied` had
no CSS rule and never have. Credit memos have rendered an unstyled badge
since the day they shipped. Vendor credits use the same two words, so both
documents are styled now.

### v2.10.3 — You can see when there is a new version

**The update notice was in the last place anyone would look.** It sat at the
bottom of the sidebar, under every menu item, so it was found only by
someone who scrolled the whole list — which meant people stayed on old
versions without knowing there was a newer one. It is at the **top** of the
sidebar now, directly under the edition line, visible the moment the app
opens. Deliberately a quiet banner rather than a dialog: it never blocks
anything, and it occupies no space at all when you are up to date. The
version you are running is shown beside the edition too, because knowing
that is half of knowing whether there is a newer one.

**Clicking an attachment returned nothing at all.** `GET
/api/attachments/download/{id}` was declared *after*
`GET /{entity_type}/{entity_id}`, and FastAPI matches in declaration order —
so `/download/2` bound the first route as entity type "download", entity 2,
and answered an empty list. The download route was never reached. You could
attach a file and never get it back, and no test caught it because every one
called the handler rather than the URL. Found by macbase1 during the gate
and reproduced by skytech; the route is reordered, a test now walks the URL
a browser walks, and a second test checks **every** route in the application
for the same shadowing, so the class is closed rather than the instance.

**The search results panel never closed.** Not on clicking away, not on
clearing the box, not on changing page — it stayed until a reload. At rest
it painted a two-pixel sliver under the toolbar in every session, which is
the grey edge along the top of the desktop screenshots taken for every
release. The JS was right all along: it adds a `hidden` class in ten places,
and **there was no rule that hid anything**, only two element-specific ones
for the modal and the splash. The generic rule the code has always assumed
now exists.

**The Quick Entry log was unreadable in dark theme** — near-white text on a
hardcoded white block, about 1.1:1 in a product that documents WCAG AA
conformance. Quick Entry exists to enter a batch and read the log back, so
the confirmation was the thing you could not see. It follows the theme now.

Both CSS defects were found by the marketing agent building the training
videos against the installed bundle, by reading what the browser computed
rather than what the stylesheet said.

**An attachment added on Windows could not be found when the same company
file was opened on a Mac or Linux.** `app/routes/attachments.py` stored the
path with the platform's own separator, so a file uploaded on Windows went
into the database as `uploads\attachments\invoice\42\report.pdf`, which
every other platform reads as a single filename. Company files move between
machines routinely — that is the point of a file you own — so this was
reachable rather than theoretical. Stored in portable form now, and read
tolerantly so rows an existing Windows install already wrote keep resolving.

It surfaced as a failing test on Windows that looked like a hardcoded slash
in an assertion. It was the product hardcoding the platform.

**The suite runs on Windows in CI** (issue #121). It ran on Linux only and
the Windows build workflow never ran it at all, which is how a Windows-only
encoding failure reached 2.10.0 with nothing able to catch it — a reader
found it, not us. No extra system libraries were needed once WeasyPrint's
import went lazy in 2.10.2, and the job enforces a skip budget, because a
portability job's worst failure is staying green while covering less.

Getting it green found **eight** Windows-only defects, seven in the tests:
two macOS-only modules needing a platform guard, a literal path compared
against one built with `Path()`, two fixtures writing a shell-script stub
Windows cannot execute, one test measuring the OCR engine check rather than
the PDF path it was written for, and — reached only once the first seven
were fixed — a test that **terminated the test runner**, because
`os.kill(pid, 0)` is a harmless existence check on POSIX and a process kill
on Windows. The launcher itself was already correct.

**A host-dependent test on macOS**, reported by @ContractorKeith in his
v2.10.2 review: the stock-install fallback test emptied `PATH` but left the
real stock locations enabled, so on a Mac with Homebrew Tesseract the
resolver correctly found `/opt/homebrew/bin/tesseract` and the assertion
failed. Same class as the Windows findings — a test that only passed where
the thing was absent. His isolation fix, applied with thanks.

**Test suite memory** (issue #124): peak 1202 MB → 698 MB and 20% faster, by
rebinding one session factory per test instead of building two fresh ones
that each registered an audit listener, and by not running the application's
startup events 2,030 times for something no route reads.

### v2.10.2 — You can edit your chart of accounts again

**2.10.1 told operators "You can rename it", and through the interface they
could not rename anything at all.** Found by skytech at the GUI while
confirming 2.10.1's control-account guard. The Chart of Accounts rendered
its Edit button only for accounts that are not system accounts, and *every*
one of the 57 accounts a new company is seeded with is a system account — so
the Actions column was empty for every row on the page. The release notes,
the changelog and the docs all promised a rename the product did not offer.

The gating predates 2.10.1 and is not a regression from it. What 2.10.1 did
was make the gap visible by publishing the promise.

**Every account has an Edit button now, and the API is the authority on what
may change.** Hiding the control pre-emptively was a reasonable belt when the
API had no opinion; it has a good one since 2.10.1, and it refuses the number
and the type of a control account with a message naming the account and its
purpose. So the button is there, renaming works, and the fifteen ordinary
seeded accounts nobody considers structural are editable again too.

**Control accounts are marked and explained.** A `CONTROL` badge on the row,
and an edit form that says which account it is, what the software posts to it,
that the number and type are fixed because a document that could not find it
would have nowhere to post — and that you can rename it. The number and type
fields are disabled rather than absent, so the reason is visible at the point
of the restriction. `GET /api/accounts` carries `is_control` and
`control_purpose`, derived from the registry, so the page cannot drift from
what the posting code actually reads.

Also resolved: a dead ternary on the accounts row (`is_system ? '' : ''`,
both branches empty) that had been standing in for the badge.

**The test suite runs without WeasyPrint's native stack** (issue #121).
Importing the app pulled in pango/cairo/gobject at module scope, so the suite
could not even be collected on a machine without them — which is how a
Windows-only failure reached 2.10.0: CI runs pytest on Linux only, the
Windows workflow never runs the suite, and the one box that would have caught
it could not import the app. WeasyPrint is imported lazily now; 1,988 of
2,025 tests run with nothing installed and the 37 that genuinely render skip
cleanly. A test skips exactly when it reached for the missing library, so
there is no marker list to forget. Both PyInstaller specs name WeasyPrint
explicitly, because a lazily imported PDF engine is not something to leave to
the scanner's discretion.

### v2.10.1 — A document is never accepted without its journal entry

**A saved invoice that never reached the books is worse than a rejected
one.** wilsons043 reported (issue #119, against the signed 2.10.0 Windows
release) that renumbering Accounts Receivable away from 1100 made every
later invoice, payment, credit memo and estimate post *no journal entry* —
while still returning success and still appearing in the A/R aging. The same
thing happened on the payables side with Accounts Payable and 2000. The
sub-ledger and the general ledger drifted apart with nothing shown to the
operator.

Two independent faults produced it, and both are fixed.

**The chart no longer lets you renumber an account the software posts to.**
Fifteen account numbers are resolved by literal value somewhere in the
code — not the six in the original report, which is why the fix is a
registry rather than a patch at one site. Changing the number or the type of
one of those is refused with a message naming the account and what it is
used for. **Renaming stays allowed**, because only the number is
load-bearing: an accountant relabelling 1100 as "Trade Debtors" was never
the problem. The guard is deliberately *not* keyed on the system-account
flag, since every seeded account carries it and renumbering an ordinary
expense account is a reasonable request.

**A posting that cannot resolve its account now stops.** The resolvers
returned `None` on a miss and their callers read that as "skip the journal
entry" — twenty places did this, covering both receivables and payables and
both manual entry and import. They raise now, and the request answers **409**
naming the missing account, with nothing written. This is the half that
matters: renumbering was only the easiest way to reach a fail-open that the
recurring-invoice and unattended import paths could also have hit.

**Opening a company file now says if its chart is incomplete**, rather than
waiting for the first document to fail. That also closes a second route the
reporter found: a company bootstrapped outside the normal path has no chart
at all and used to accept documents that posted nothing.

*Why nothing caught this.* Through all of it the trial balance **balanced** —
debits equalled credits to the cent, because the ledger stayed internally
consistent and was simply missing an entry. Our three-platform release gate
compares trial balances every release and would have passed this every time.
Only tying a control account to its sub-ledger finds it. The regression test
asserts that tie-out, not the balance.

Thanks to wilsons043 for a report that included a clean reproduction, the
root cause, and the sixteen call sites they had read but not run.

### v2.10.0 — The bank register is the ledger

**A register entry moves the general ledger, and the register shows what the
ledger has.** Discussion #112 (a QuickBooks user) asked why a −500 entered in
the checking register left account 1000 untouched; the answer was that the
register had been a side ledger since day one — its own rows, its own stored
balance, imports that never posted, documents that never appeared in it,
reconciliation ticking rows the ledger had never seen. From 2.10 the ledger
is the only ledger (issue #114).

**What a bank account is now.** A chart account flagged `bank` or
`credit_card` (Checking, Savings and Credit Card come flagged; Chart of
Accounts can flag others). Every "paid from", "deposit to" and "pay from"
picker lists exactly those, and the register, transfers and reconciliation
are keyed by the ledger account. A bank feed (SimpleFIN, OFX/QFX, CSV) is the
account's statement identity and must link to a ledger account.

**One sign rule.** An amount above zero goes into the account (a deposit, a
card payment), below zero comes out (a payment, a card charge) — the same on
a bank and on a card; a card's register shows the amount owed as a positive
number. Statement lines already arrive that way, so nothing is flipped.

**Register entries post** (DR category / CR account for money out, the
reverse for money in; a bank or card category makes it a transfer). **Transfers**
are a document: paying a card is a transfer from the bank to the card. Credit
card charges pick the card (default 2100) and can be voided; so can register
entries and transfers. A void refuses an entry a completed reconciliation
holds and hands any matched statement lines back to the review queue.

**Statement lines are a review queue.** On import each line looks for the one
posting the ledger already has for it (same amount, same side, within five
days; a check number narrows it; two equal candidates stay unmatched — no
guessing). Bank rules suggest a category and never post. What is left waits in
*To review* on the account: **Add** posts it with the category, **Match** links
it to something already entered, **Exclude** drops it, **Add all categorised**
posts the rule-suggested lines in one click that says what it skipped.

**Reconciliation runs over the ledger's lines**: the prior statement's balance
is the beginning balance, ticks clear ledger lines, matched statement lines
arrive cleared, and completing locks the lines. One open reconciliation per
account; Abandon keeps the ticks.

**Upgrading.** The old register balance is not posted for you — a migration
must not write ledger lines you have not reviewed. The Banking page shows the
number once, with **Post as opening balance** (against 3900 Opening Balance
Equity, created on demand) or **Dismiss**. Feeds that were never linked get a
bank account created and linked. Rows ticked in the old reconciliations are
excluded from the queue (Restore brings one back). API changes: `POST
/api/banking/accounts` needs `account_id` and takes `opening_balance` (the old
`balance` is a 422); `POST /api/banking/transactions` needs
`category_account_id` and returns the journal entry; `GET
/api/banking/transactions` lists statement lines only; reconciliations take
`account_id`. The Check Register page is the Banking register (old bookmarks
redirect).

**QA baseline.** The shared NEONpulse fixture posts its bank account's 42,500
opening balance now, so the cross-platform trial balance moves from
3,316,390.46 to 3,358,890.46 — deliberately, once.

**Also in 2.10.0 — PDF receipts scan on Windows and macOS with nothing to
install (issue #116).** Scanning an image on the desktop apps has used the OS
engine since 2.9, but a PDF first has to become an image and only poppler's
`pdftoppm` did that — a tool the installers do not ship, so a PDF on Windows
answered "PDF scanning requires poppler-utils". The Windows app now renders
page 1 with Windows.Data.Pdf and the macOS app with Quartz, both already in
the bundle; poppler-utils stays the Linux path and the fallback anywhere it is
on PATH. When nothing can render, the message names the fix for the platform
you are on. `GET /api/ocr/status` reports `pdf` (`windows` | `macos` |
`poppler` | null) and the Settings OCR row shows it. A renderer's own error text
(a WinRT HRESULT, a Quartz message) stays in the log; the response says the PDF
could not be read.

**Dependency: WeasyPrint 69.0 → 70.0** (CVE-2026-55073, GHSA-jf6q-chmf-3h3v: two
`write_pdf()` channels ignored a document's `url_fetcher`). The app's fetcher
was already data-URI-only and the templates never pass those channels, so no
SlowBooks PDF was exposed; the pin moves because the scanner flags 69.0 and
because 70.0 made the fetcher a class the library enforces everywhere
(`allowed_protocols`). A regression test renders `file://` images, stylesheets
and `@import`s and asserts the file's bytes never reach the PDF.

**Three Windows/launcher gaps from the 2.9.x gates closed.** The Windows exe now
carries a version resource (FileVersion, ProductVersion, ProductName from the
app version — Properties → Details and inventory tools can read it; the build
fails if it is missing; issue #106). A headless `--serve-lan` / `--no-window`
run no longer rewrites the desktop app's `.env` DATABASE_URL or last-opened
company, so it cannot repoint the next windowed launch (issue #110). Two
error strings that interpolated another library's exception text (the stored
scan image reader, the custom AI worker URL parser) now say the problem in the
app's own words (issue #111).

**macOS release tooling (testing-repo #28, macbase1).** `release.py` retries a
codesign step up to three times when Apple's timestamp service answers
"A timestamp was expected but was not found" — that failure alone; any other
signing error stops the run on the first try. The app bundle's
`CFBundleVersion` is now `<version>+<12-char git SHA>` so two builds of one
release can be told apart from the bundle itself (the Windows exe got the same
treatment in #106); the macOS workflow refuses a bundle without it.

**Cash flow statement follows the cash** (PR #117, @jsonmez). The report used to
sum the net change of every account — both sides of every journal, non-cash
accruals such as an unpaid bill, and opening-balance carry-forwards — and could
overstate the period's cash change several times over. It now reads only the
non-cash side of journals that touch a bank account (the chart's `bank` kind),
classifies each cash movement once, and leaves opening-balance entries out;
transfers between bank accounts net to nothing. Investing shows a purchase as
an outflow directly, so the old sign flip is gone.

### v2.9.4 — The company logo on every document; exception text stays in the log

**Every PDF now carries the company logo when one is set.** The logo
helper fed only the analytics PDF and the new-hire report; invoices,
estimates, statements, collection letters, donor acknowledgments, giving
statements and the financial reports never received it, though the
features list said they did (discussion #108). The render helper attaches
it to every document and each header shows it. (The estimate and report
templates now also receive the vocabulary dictionary the other documents had;
nothing in them uses it yet.) Checks print on pre-printed stock and stay
logo-free on purpose.

**Exception text stays in the server log.** The QuickBooks Online import,
export and OAuth callback, the IIF import and the QuickBooks report CSV
importer answered failures with the exception's own words, which can carry
paths and provider responses (CodeQL stack-trace exposure, five alerts).
They now log the traceback and say only that the step failed; data problems
in the CSV importer keep their wording. The donor acknowledgment preview's
reason is a fixed phrase off a typed exception, as it always meant to be.

### v2.9.3 — SimpleFIN request pinned to the address the guard approved

**One security fix, right behind 2.9.2.** The SimpleFIN SSRF guard resolved
the bridge hostname and refused private addresses, then the HTTP client
resolved the name again to connect — a second DNS answer could steer the
socket at a private service (DNS rebinding; CodeQL py/full-ssrf, #104,
raised on the 2.9.2 pull request and wrongly dismissed as guarded). The
request now connects to the address the guard checked, with the hostname
kept for the Host header and TLS (the certificate is still verified against
the hostname), and a response from a non-global peer is discarded.

### v2.9.2 — Security: HR and payroll are admin-only; payment row locks; Server Edition CSP; SimpleFIN on PostgreSQL

**Security (Server Edition).** Four private reports arrived on the same
morning, three from @hongshengy and one from @furkan-arslan-sec, and all four
were right. The role gate treated everything outside six admin prefixes as
"daily books", so a bookkeeper could mint any employee's self-service portal
token (a full login as that employee: W-4, bank accounts, pay stubs), rewrite
any employee's direct-deposit account and export the NACHA file, and a
read-only user could download pay stubs, W-2s and I-9 paperwork. The docs
said HR and payroll were admin functions; the code now agrees: payroll,
tax forms, benefits, garnishments, onboarding, and the credential-bearing
parts of an employee record (portal token, bank accounts, documents,
E-Verify, year-to-date) are refused to bookkeeper and read-only roles for
every method; creating or editing an employee is an admin write; the
employee list stays readable as a directory with pay, tax and address fields
blanked for non-admins. The SPA hides those pages for non-admins. Separately,
batch payments and bill payments now take the same row lock on the invoice
or bill that single payments already did, so two concurrent requests on
PostgreSQL cannot both pass the balance check and over-apply; an
over-application that slips past the check is refused with 409 instead of a
negative balance. Advisories GHSA-rh68-48w8-pj8r, GHSA-rh75-6834-f66j,
GHSA-pwj7-6qq3-h4fj, GHSA-rm5h-555g-vpjj; fixed in 2.9.2.

**Server Edition no longer serves the desktop's relaxed script policy to
LAN browsers.** The launcher marks every server it starts as "desktop",
including headless `--serve-lan`, so the `'unsafe-eval'` allowance the
native web view needs went to the whole office (found by Keith in the
post-release macOS review). The policy is now decided per request: relaxed
only when the launcher flag is set *and* the request arrived over
loopback, which is the only way the web view ever connects. **SimpleFIN
settings on PostgreSQL** — the settings table was created with a 500-
character value column that SQLite ignores and PostgreSQL enforces, and a
bank feed's access URL is longer than that; the column is now text
(contributed by @kycrna). **Bank feeds can target a liability account**,
so a credit card feed lands where the card lives (also @kycrna).

### v2.9.1 — Post-release tidy from the 2.9.0 gate

**A stored AI provider key can be removed.** `PUT /api/analytics/ai-config`
with `"api_key": ""` clears it (omit the field to keep it; a value replaces
it), the spec says so, and the Settings page has a Remove button beside the
saved-key mark — it no longer round-trips a blank field. **Windows releases
publish `SHA256SUMS.windows`** beside the installer and zip, the same
format as the macOS file, so a download can be checked without trusting
the transport. **The migrations now create every table** (`api_tokens` was
the last one only app startup made), so `alembic upgrade head` alone yields
the complete schema. Two nonprofit vocabulary leaks closed: the
Contributions by Donor card described "sales totals", and the analytics
receivables aging header said "Customer". The macOS maintainer runbook
describes the staple-before-DMG order that has shipped since 2.9.0, and the
install guide's table and account counts are current.

### v2.9.0 — Nonprofit mode

**A nonprofit sees its own words in the first minute.** Settings → Company
Type → Nonprofit swaps the vocabulary everywhere it shows: Customer → Donor,
Invoice → Pledge, Sales Receipt → Donation, Class → Fund, Job → Grant, Profit
& Loss → Statement of Activities, Balance Sheet → Statement of Financial
Position, Equity → Net Assets. One dictionary, applied at render, on screens,
in report titles, in PDF filenames and on the dashboard; nothing in the API
or the database changes name, and a business file renders exactly what it
did before. Printed documents are literal, not vocabulary: a donation prints
as DONATION RECEIPT, a pledge as PLEDGE, a program fee still as INVOICE.

**Net assets by restriction, without a closing entry.** A class is a fund
with a restriction (without / with donor restrictions, purpose or permanent)
and a default function. When a restricted fund spends for its purpose, a
**Release from Restriction** moves that much to net assets without donor
restrictions — one document, DR 3400 / CR 3300 tagged to the fund, with the
amount suggested from the fund's unreleased spending. The **Statement of
Financial Position** splits the change in net assets by restriction at
report time, the way the balance sheet already synthesizes net income, so
the two net-asset lines always add up to the balance sheet's equity; the
**Statement of Activities** shows revenue and expenses in two columns with
releases between them and its change in net assets is the P&L net income;
**Fund Balances** shows each restricted fund's beginning, contributions,
spending, releases, ending and unreleased. P&L by Class now groups on the
line's class first (a bill with three line classes and a blank header used
to land whole in Uncategorized), and every void reverses with job, class,
cost code and function carried.

**Every expense knows its function.** Posted lines carry program /
management / fundraising, defaulted from the fund. Shared costs — rent, the
office manager's wages — are posted unassigned and divided by a saved
**allocation rule** (percent, square feet, or hours on grants), either with
**Split** on the entry line or as a month-end **Functional Allocation** that
reclasses whatever is still unassigned on the rule's source account without
moving the P&L by a cent; running a month twice finds nothing to move. The
**Statement of Functional Expenses** puts every expense account in Form 990
Part IX columns, with the program-by-program breakout, as PDF and CSV.

**Donor documents.** A donation receipt prints the IRS Publication 1771
acknowledgment — the date, the amount, and either "no goods or services were
provided" or the fair value of the gala dinner with the deductible portion.
Every gift gets an **acknowledgment letter** (PDF and email) worded by the
editable `donation_acknowledgment` template with `{{ irs.text }}` supplied.
**In-kind gifts** are their own two-sided document (the piano to Musical
Instruments, the credit to In-Kind Contributions) acknowledged without a
stated value. **Year-end giving statements** list every cash gift with the
deductible portion and non-cash gifts without amounts — one donor, every
donor in one PDF with a page break each, or emailed to everyone who has not
opted out. The **pledge report** reads promised, invoiced, received, written
off and outstanding off recurring pledges and their installments (generated
invoices now remember their template and carry its grant), and a pledge that
will never be paid is **written off** through a credit memo to Bad Debt
Expense — credit memos gained the void they never had, which is also the
undo.

**Reports you can find and compare.** In the desktop app, Save PDF now
writes the report to Documents → SlowBooks Pro → Reports (period-stamped, never
overwritten), opens it, and says where it went with a Show-in-folder button —
it used to land in a temp folder. Saved report definitions are a collapsible
list at the top of the Report Center instead of a growing wall of cards. The
Statement of Activities and the Statement of Functional Expenses gained
"Compare to prior year": the same dates a year earlier as two more columns,
on screen, in the PDF and in the CSV.

**Riverbend Community Arts.** The stage's acceptance test is a seeded
nonprofit year — a grant, an endowment, a gala, pledgers, a piano, rent
split 70/20/10, a June release — driven entirely through the API with scoped
tokens the way a bring-your-own-AI agent would, checking that every
statement reconciles to the cent and that a readonly agent cannot write.

guide: [docs/nonprofit-module.md](docs/nonprofit-module.md).

**A custom AI provider** (contributed by @jarvis4openclaw): an eighth AI
Insights provider that points at any OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint on the
public internet, HTTPS-only and behind the same address guard as the Worker
gateway, with the model ID yours to type. Along the way it fixed the
self-hosted Cloudflare Worker gateway, whose replies had been parsed to an
empty string.

**From the release gate (SlowBooks-Pro-Testing, 2.9.0).** The macOS app is
now notarized and stapled *before* the disk image is built, so the copy a
user drags to Applications carries its own ticket and launches offline;
the bundle declares why it writes to Documents and Downloads, and a refused
folder is explained (the file goes to the app's data folder and the notice
says so) instead of failing like a crash. For agents driving the API: an
unknown request field is a 422 naming the field, never silently dropped;
`tax_rate` is documented as a fraction and a percent-looking value is
rejected with the unit in the message; `pto_type` and `accrual_method` are
enums in the spec; an empty pay run is refused with the roster named;
`DELETE` on a posted document names the `/void` route; a fresh company has
6810 Depreciation Expense and a default Equipment asset type so depreciation
runs first time; a missing `companies.json` is logged with the data
directory that was searched.

**Round 3 of the gate found the macOS desktop bridge dead — since v2.1.0.**
Save PDF, print preview, Save backup, Show in folder and the company picker
all rely on pywebview's `window.pywebview.api`, which pywebview builds with
`new Function`; the app's Content-Security-Policy had no `'unsafe-eval'`,
WebKit enforces that inside the page, and the bridge stayed empty on every
Mac while Chromium on Windows let it through. The policy now allows eval
only under the desktop launcher (a browser install keeps the strict one).
The shell also stops failing in silence: a missing bridge is reported on the
first click and checked at startup, Save CSV goes through the bridge to the
same Reports folder as Save PDF, and every export a desktop fetch receives
is served inline so neither webview swallows it as a download. Two more
from the same round: first-run setup on a file that already holds books now
says whose books they are and prefills the name, and the company name in
Settings keeps the manifest (the picker's name) in step so the two can no
longer diverge; the Windows installer clears `_internal` before an upgrade
so stale package metadata from earlier builds no longer ships.
Round 4 closed the loop on the name reconciliation itself: two company files
can never end up with one name — renaming a company (in Settings or in
first-run setup) to a name another file already carries is refused with the
file named, the same rule creating a company has always applied.
The Linux gate then found that `docker compose up` had been broken since
v2.8.0: no migration ever created the `users` table (the app made it at
startup), and the v2.8.0 preferences migration referenced it, which SQLite
tolerates and PostgreSQL refuses. A migration now creates `users` ahead of
that reference, a test walks the migrated schema for any foreign key whose
target no migration creates, and under PostgreSQL the company list flags
the database the server is connected to as current so an agent can tell
which books it reached.
Behind that lay an older one: the production guards that demand a TLS
database connection and an HTTPS redirect refused the compose stack's own
plaintext bridge-network URL, so the documented one-command install had not
started since those guards landed in v2.1. The compose file now declares
`SLOWBOOKS_PRIVATE_NETWORK=1`, which relaxes exactly those two transport
checks with a logged warning and nothing else; the encryption-key guards are
never relaxed, and the install guide says what to change before exposing
the stack beyond the host.
And a third, once the stack ran: with two uvicorn workers, both raced to
create the tables the migrations do not cover, one lost on a Postgres enum
type, and the container crashed and restarted on every first boot. Table
creation now takes a Postgres advisory lock so the second worker waits.

### v2.8.0 — Benefits, all-state payroll, and an overview you can arrange

### Export parity with import (#70)

**What comes in from QuickBooks can go back out.** IIF export now writes
everything the importer reads: the `!CLASS` list (names verbatim, archived
as HIDDEN=Y), a `CLASS` column on every transaction block so a tag never
falls off on the way out, jobs as `Customer:Job` rows, and three block
types that were import-only since they were added — **bills**, **deposits**
and **sales receipts** (`CASH SALE`). A full export re-imports into the same
books with no errors and no duplicates. CSV export gained bills, deposits,
sales receipts, classes and jobs, with class, job and cost code on every
line. The IIF and Import/Export pages carry buttons for all of it.

### Accessibility

**Striving toward WCAG 2.1 AA.** The audit's six app findings are fixed:
every table header declares its scope, icon-only remove and close buttons
carry labels, toast notifications announce through a live region, modals
are real dialogs (focus moves in, Tab stays inside, Escape closes, focus
returns to what opened them), the reconciliation difference says
"Balanced" or "Out of balance" in words rather than colour alone, and the
muted text colour now clears the AA contrast ratio in both themes. The
bigger gap was PDFs: every PDF the app produces — invoices, statements,
pay stubs, W-2s, 1099s, 940/941, reports — is now **tagged (PDF/UA-1)** with
a declared language and title, so a screen reader gets headings, tables
and reading order instead of a picture of text. See
[docs/accessibility.md](docs/accessibility.md) for the statement and the
contact path; this is a commitment, not a compliance claim.

### Sales tax per line

**A labor line and a taxed part can share one invoice.** The invoice's tax
rate used to apply to the whole subtotal, even though items already carried
a taxable flag. Now every line on an invoice, estimate, sales receipt and
recurring invoice has a **Tax** checkbox: it starts from the item's flag
(and turns off for every line when the customer is marked non-taxable), you
can flip it per line, the totals only tax the checked lines, the flag rides
from an estimate into the invoice it becomes and from a recurring template
onto every invoice it generates, the Sales Tax report's taxable base counts
only taxed lines, and the PDF marks non-taxable lines when the document
carries tax. Field report from an IT shop that repairs customer-owned
devices (untaxed labor) and sells the part with install (taxed) on the
same invoice.

### Customizable overview

**The Company Snapshot is yours to arrange.** A **Customize** button on the
overview lets you hide any card, move cards up or down, and add cards from
a catalog; **Save layout** remembers it for your login (each user on a
Server Edition company gets their own; the single-password operator gets
one shared layout), and **Reset** brings back the standard overview. The
classic cards are all there — receivables, overdue invoices, active
customers, payables, bank balances, A/R aging, monthly revenue, recent
invoices and payments — and five new ones join the catalog:

- **P&L: This Month vs Last** — income, expenses and net side by side.
- **Cash Position** — cash on hand plus a 30-day forecast from receivables
  and payables coming due (assumes customers pay on the due date).
- **Open Purchase Orders** — committed but not yet billed, with the job.
- **Receipts to Review** — scanned receipts waiting to become a bill or
  expense, and how long before they expire.
- **Jobs: Budget vs Actual** — active jobs ranked by projected variance,
  each a click from its job page.

Every card loads independently, so one card with a problem shows its
error in place instead of taking the page down. The overdue-invoices card
now names who owes what and by how many days.

### Benefits engine

**A benefit is a code with a rule.** Payroll evaluates whatever codes are
attached to an employee: kind (deduction, benefit, both), calculation
method, which wage bases the pre-tax side reduces, an explicit sequence
(pre-tax codes apply in order and each changes the taxable base for the
next), and three separate limits — per period, annual, and a wage-base
ceiling. Rates are effective-dated and resolve against the pay-period end
date; processed runs snapshot the rules they used so a later change never
rewrites history. The employer side has its own rate and method including
tiered 401(k) matching, an expense and liability account per code, and a
remittance vendor — the Remittance tab totals what is owed and creates the
vendor bill. Employee groups are templates; an enrollment overrides them.
Loan-style codes carry a balance and stop at zero. PTO banks now carry
dollars and can post the accrued liability. The Deductions page became
Benefits; garnishments have their own page. Existing deduction types and
elections migrate onto codes and enrollments.

### Actual labor burden on jobs

Set the Labor cost type's burden method to **payroll** and the pay run
distributes real employer taxes plus job-routed benefit codes across the
jobs each employee's time entries hit, by hours, P&L-neutral. Time entries
then post base labor only. Replaces the flat percent from v2.7.0.

### State withholding for all 50 states and DC

Every state resolves to a payroll engine (Washington, California, New York
and Oregon keep their dedicated ones). The figures are the 2026 published
values with the source named per state in `docs/state-withholding.md`.
Employees gain the state W-4 inputs: allowances, extra state withholding,
an elected rate (Arizona), and a flat local rate for county and city taxes.
Verify against your state before filing; the table is re-checked every
January.

### Employee portal link

On the desktop the link now opens in the employee's browser instead of
inside SlowBooks, and Copy Link / Email to Employee give a full address.
The Details view says where that address is reachable from.

### Small things

- `GET /api/sales-receipts` lists receipts for API clients.
- The Company Snapshot is titled with your company name, which also sits
  in the toolbar and the window title.
- The splash shows what's new in the version you're running.

### Benefits engine — from the first macOS lap

- A post-tax deduction larger than the check used to leave a negative net
  pay on the stub and an unbalanced payroll entry on processing. Post-tax
  codes now take what is left after taxes and garnishments, in sequence,
  with the shortfall noted on the stub; net pay never goes below zero.
- The remittance report and bill follow a code's current vendor when the
  run was processed before the vendor was assigned.

### v2.7.0 — Jobs, job costing, and receipt intake

The two most-requested features since Server Edition, each field-tested on
Windows (SkyTech / VonHolten308) and macOS (Keith's laps on #73 and #86).
#### Jobs — QuickBooks-style Customer:Job / Projects (milestone 1)

**Every posted line can now carry a job (and a class).** A job is a
customer's project — "Smith: Kitchen Remodel" — and the unit of job
costing. Invoices, bills, expenses, card charges, journal entries, sales
receipts and estimates take a Job on the header; invoice, bill and journal
lines can set their own job and class, and a line without one inherits the
header's. The ledger line is the source of truth, so the new **Jobs** page
(Customers & Sales) and the **Job Profitability** report show income,
costs, net and margin per job straight from posted activity — the "No job"
row holds everything untagged, so the report's totals equal the Profit &
Loss for the same period, the same reconciliation promise P&L by Class
makes. Job detail lists every posted line attributed to it (the job cost
detail). The Customer Center lists a customer's jobs and can create one.

Jobs carry what a contractor tracks: status (pending, awarded, in progress,
closed, not awarded), job number, type, dates, site address and contract
amount, so the detail can show billed-vs-contract. A job with posted
activity is never deleted — mark it inactive and it leaves the pickers.

**The cost model: drill-down, every kind of cost, burden, budgets and
variance (milestone 3).** Feedback from the first lap was that jobs
existed but there was no way to drill down or to get the extra and
edge-case costs onto them. Now:

- **Cost codes nest** (division › code › sub-code, any depth) with roll-ups
  at every level, your own numbering, and a CSV import
  (`code,name,cost_type,parent_code`). **Cost types are yours to edit** —
  add permits, bonding, warranty, split labor — each with a burden % and
  the accounts it posts through.
- **Job Cost Entry**, a new document for costs that aren't a bill:
  internal labor at an employee's loaded rate, owned-equipment hours from
  an Equipment list, mileage, small tools, burden, corrections. It debits
  job cost (tagged to job, code and type) and credits an offset account
  (applied labor, applied equipment, applied overhead — all contra-expense
  accounts on the P&L) — the applied-cost pattern, so the company P&L is
  unchanged while every job carries its share. Settings → Cost Types →
  **Create default offset accounts** sets all of that up in one click,
  pointing each cost type at the chart's own COGS account (Materials,
  Labor, Subcontractor) so the P&L keeps its cost categories. **Allocate a Cost** spreads one amount
  across jobs by labor hours, revenue, costs, equally, or by weights.
- **Time entries post to jobs.** Employees get a job cost rate and a burden
  %; approved time tagged to a job posts as labor cost at that rate
  (overtime at 1.5×, double-time at 2×) with the burden as its own line,
  one click from the time list or the job's Time tab.
- **Budgets and variance.** Each job carries a budget per cost code (or
  per type, or whole-job), seeded from an estimate — estimate lines gained
  a cost code and a unit cost, so cost = qty × unit cost and revenue = the
  line amount — or typed in. The job page shows, at every level, the
  columns contractors read weekly: Original, Changes, Budget, Committed,
  Actual, Projected (actual + committed), Variance (budget − projected),
  % Used, and estimated vs actual revenue.
- **The job page** replaces the modal: Overview (headline figures and a
  by-type table), Cost Detail (the expandable tree — type › division ›
  code › sub-code › posted lines, each line opening its bill, invoice,
  expense, journal entry or job cost), Budget, Transactions and Time tabs,
  with a period filter and a job-to-date default. A **Job Budget vs
  Actual** report lists every job's headline figures.
- Also fixed on the way: the Time Entry form was sending hours under the
  wrong field names, so every entry saved with zero hours.
- From the first macOS lap: the labor offset was a balance-sheet account,
  so labor landed on the P&L twice once payroll ran — it is a P&L contra
  now, like the other offsets. Rejecting a time entry that was already
  posted to a job voids that job cost. Re-seeding a budget from an
  estimate leaves hand-edited rows alone, and an estimate line with no
  unit cost budgets zero cost (unknown) rather than the sale price.

**Cost codes, billable costs and committed cost (milestone 2).** Settings
gained a **Cost Codes** chart — which part of a job a cost belongs to ("03
Concrete", "26 Electrical"), each with a cost type (labor, material,
subcontract, equipment, other) and an optional default account — with a
one-click load of the CSI MasterFormat divisions. Bill lines, journal
lines, purchase-order lines and expenses take a cost code, and bill lines
and expenses can be marked **billable** to the job's customer (the
unbilled-costs-to-invoice step arrives with progress billing). The job
detail rolls costs up by code and type, and shows **committed cost**: the
value of sent, partially received and received purchase orders tagged to
the job that has not yet become a bill. Purchase orders take a Job on the
header (and per line); converting one to a bill carries job and cost code
onto every bill line.

**QuickBooks migration keeps the hierarchy.** IIF imports split
`Customer:Job` names into the customer and a job under it (customer list
rows and every invoice, sales receipt and estimate); QBO imports turn
sub-customers ("Projects") into jobs under their parent. A flat customer
that already carries the colon from an earlier import keeps matching, so
re-imports are stable.

The estimate form also gained the Class field that was computed but never
rendered. Design and the rest of the plan (cost codes, committed cost,
change orders, progress billing, time and burden, WIP):
[docs/design/projects.md](docs/design/projects.md).

#### Receipt intake — scan a receipt into the Sales Receipt / Bill form

A new **Scan Receipt** button on both the Enter Sales Receipt and Enter
Bill forms uploads a receipt image or PDF, runs it through local OCR
(Tesseract), and pre-fills the form: date, merchant/vendor hint, and the
grand total as a single line (Qty 1 × Rate = total), with detected tax
split out on the Sales Receipt form (tax rate field) and noted in Bill
Notes (bills have no tax field). The operator always reviews before
saving, and the source image/PDF attaches to the saved document so every
scanned entry keeps its evidence.

Per the design notes, this is **zero new Python dependencies** —
tesseract and poppler-utils are called directly via subprocess and stay
the user's install (never bundled into the signed installers); the
Docker image installs both system packages. When the binary is absent,
the feature degrades gracefully: the button is disabled and the Settings
page shows "install Tesseract to enable scanning." Parsing is
deterministic (regex/anchor extraction for date, total, tax, merchant) —
no AI, no bundled models. Design + API contract:
[docs/design/receipt-intake-spec.md](docs/design/receipt-intake-spec.md).

**Expenses — the form most receipts actually belong on.** A receipt for
something already paid (card, cash, check) is neither a bill (money
still owed) nor a sales receipt (money taken in); entering one used to
mean a bill plus a payment, or a journal entry. The new **Expenses**
page (Vendors & Payables) records it in one step — vendor, expense
account, the bank or credit-card account it was paid from, amount — as
a single balanced posting (DR expense, CR paid-from), with the Scan
Receipt button, box-to-fix canvas, and attachment on save, exactly like
bills. Paid From lists bank/cash assets and credit-card liabilities,
defaulting to Checking.

**Vendor quick-add on the Bill and Expense forms.** A scanned merchant
the books don't know yet no longer dead-ends the form: the vendor
picker gained "+ New Vendor" with an inline name box; a scan that
doesn't match an existing vendor pre-fills it, and the vendor is
created on save (a near-duplicate name resolves to the existing
record instead of a twin).

**Box-to-fix canvas hardening**, from the first hands-on hardware lap:
a box dragged over two figures (tax + tip) is refused with the numbers
it saw rather than silently taking the first; any refused read — no
value, two values, or a value the form won't accept (a "tax" larger
than the subtotal) — leaves no box on the scan and no stale value on
the field buttons, so the next drag starts clean. Field buttons moved
below the canvas, a drag paints immediately, and a box recolors the
moment it's labeled instead of after the read comes back.

**Highlights land on the right words.** The colored boxes the scan
draws over the image are placed by matching the parsed values back to
the recognized words; a receipt that prints the same figure twice (a
line-item price and the grand total, or "CASH" repeating the total)
used to get the box on the first hit, and the Date box went to the
first thing with a slash or dash in it (an invoice number). The boxes
now go to the word on the labeled line — lowest one for totals — and
to the word that actually prints the parsed date in whatever order the
receipt used. The values on the form were already right; only the
highlight moved.

**Merchant template memory** no longer anchors a remembered box on a
word that repeats on the page when a unique label is on the same line
("Inclusive" over "GST"), records which occurrence it meant when every
label repeats, and fails closed — canvas takes over — when a rescan
doesn't repeat the anchor the same way. A remembered amount or date box
that reads only a bare digit run on a new print (a template that landed
on a tax-ID number) is discarded instead of filling the form with it.

**Windows: the second scan of a session no longer crashes the app.** On
Windows the built-in text recognizer was driven from a throwaway thread
per scan; when that thread exited, Windows tore down the component
runtime the recognizer had been created in, and the next scan jumped
through a stale handle — the server process died and the window
reported "SlowBooks isn't responding (network error)" right after the
first bill or expense was saved from a receipt. All recognizer work now
runs on one thread that lives as long as the app does.

**The merchant name gets a highlight box too.** The scan now boxes the
run of words on the image that spells the parsed merchant name (pink),
alongside the totals and date, so it can be corrected by tapping like
the others; a name recalled from a remembered layout that isn't printed
on the page draws nothing.

**Bill numbers come off the receipt, and never block the entry.** The
Bill # is the vendor's own invoice number — that is what stops the same
invoice being entered twice (the check is per vendor, so two vendors
can both send invoice 111). The scan now reads it from the receipt
("Invoice No", "Receipt #", "Check", "Trans No" …) into Bill # and the
expense Reference; a receipt that prints none can be saved with the
field blank and gets `<date>-<vendor initials>` (suffixed if that vendor
already has one that day).

**Expenses can be voided.** A recorded expense booked to the wrong
account (checking instead of the credit card) now has a Void button on
the list and in its detail; like bills and journal entries it posts the
mirror-image reversing entry, keeps the original in the ledger, respects
the closing date, and shows the row as void. Enter it again to correct.

**Scan Receipt field buttons are readable in dark mode.** The Total /
Tax / Subtotal / Date / Merchant buttons under the receipt used pale
fills with dark text regardless of theme — near-invisible on the dark
theme. Dark mode now uses deep opaque fills with light text (8–10:1
contrast); light mode keeps the pale fills with darker text.

**Invoice / Ref # has its own box on the scan.** The picker under the
receipt gained an **Invoice / Ref #** button (teal): draw it around the
vendor's document number and it lands in Bill Number (bills) or
Reference (expenses); the auto-parse also outlines the number it found,
and a taught box is remembered per merchant like the others. The
auto-parse no longer skips an invoice line because a "Pax"/"Table"/"Tel"
word sits after the number on the same line.

**Day-first dates parse.** `14-02-2018`, `14/02/2018`, `14.02.18` — any
numeric date whose US reading is impossible — now resolves day-first
(US ordering still wins when both readings are valid, so `12/02/17` is
December 2), and month-name dates accept a two-digit year or dashes
(`28 Mar 18`, `05-JAN-2017`). A date box that reads something the parser cannot turn into
a date no longer reports "applied to the form" while the date input
stays empty; it says what it read and asks for a redraw or a manual
entry.

**US register tape parses (Walmart, Whole Foods, Costco phone photos).**
`TAX 1 7.000 %` is a tax *rate* line, not a 7.00 tax — a third decimal
or a trailing % never reads as money. A return-policy or promotion line
("purchases made on or after 9/15/2020") can no longer supply the
transaction date. Walmart's `TC#` is the receipt number; the `REF #`
printed beside APPR CODE / NETWORK ID / TERMINAL # is the card
authorization and is ignored. The Invoice / Ref # button is present on
the picker under the receipt (build 47 drew the box but had no button
to assign it to).

**Tilted photos read the right rows.** On a phone photo taken a couple of
degrees off square, the amounts down the right edge of a 2000-pixel
receipt sit a full line below the labels they belong to, and the row
builder for the native engines put them on the neighbouring row — total
survived but subtotal and tax silently took the wrong values (found on
the macOS hardware pass). The engines now report each line's tilt (Apple
Vision from its corner points, Windows OCR from its line grouping) and
the rows are straightened before they are read; verified to 8 degrees.
Also from that pass: the Settings OCR row names the built-in engine
instead of assuming Tesseract everywhere, Apple Vision lists its
recognition languages, and the macOS build's smoke test now proves Vision
survived freezing.

**Desktop launcher:** `--data-dir` (Server Edition scheduled task,
headless test rigs) now relocates the per-user `.env` along with the
data directory; it used to write `DATABASE_URL` into the launching
user's own `%LOCALAPPDATA%` `.env`.

### v2.6.3 — Classes cross over, and report CSVs read ANSI

**Classes now come across from QuickBooks.** A class list export
(File > Utilities > Export > Lists > Class List) previously vanished on
import: the IIF parser only recognized accounts, customers, vendors and
items, so the `!CLASS` section fell through the skip-unknown-sections
path. A transaction IIF never carries the definitions either — CLASS
appears only as a column on split lines — which left no way into the
class list but typing every name into Settings → Classes by hand, and
every transaction citing one failed its document. The list imports now,
ahead of anything that can cite a class, so a single file holding both
the list and the transactions lands in one pass. QuickBooks'
"Parent:Child" subclass paths are kept verbatim (the split lines use
that same path, so this is exactly what makes the two match), inactive
classes arrive archived, and re-importing a list is a no-op. An unknown
class on a transaction still stops that document rather than being
invented — the error now names the list export as the fix. (#69)

**Report-CSV import follow-ups**, from the #62 post-merge review: block
types the Check and Deposit Detail parsers don't handle are now counted
and warned about ("3 'Bill Pmt -Check' block(s) skipped") instead of
being silently dropped, so a full Check Detail export no longer looks
like it imported cleanly when it didn't. CSV uploads also fall back to
Windows-1252 when UTF-8 fails — QuickBooks Desktop's Save-as-CSV
frequently writes ANSI, and a payee like "José" used to 500 the upload.
All four CSV import endpoints got the fix; a file neither encoding can
read returns a guided error. (#67)

### v2.6.2 — Report-CSV imports & field fixes

**Field fixes** (both from a Server Edition user's report, #64/#65):

- Creating a customer or vendor with a blank Email box failed with an
  unexplained "unprocessable entity" — blank email now means "no
  email", and validation errors name the field they're about.
  (Workaround before this release was entering any valid email.)
- The Server Edition install script now copies existing desktop books
  (company files, encryption key, uploads, backups) into the server's
  data home, as the docs always claimed; a wrong run location stops
  with a guided message; and — found reproducing the report on real
  hardware — the startup task could never be registered from the
  normal installed path at all (PowerShell 5.1 mangled the quoting on
  the spaced "Program Files" path and the script printed success over
  the failure). Task creation is fixed and failures now stop the
  script loudly. Field-verified end-to-end on hardware.

### Deposits and checks from QuickBooks report CSVs

The report-CSV path now covers three exports, auto-detected by their
columns on one upload: **Deposit Detail** (each deposit becomes the
journal entry moving its payments from Undeposited Funds to the bank),
**Check Detail** (bank credit + expense debits — including payroll
checks, whose withholding lines credit their liability accounts and
net to the check amount; sign-aware parsing again, proven against a
real customer's export), and the Transaction Detail sales-receipt
report below. Blocks that don't balance or reference missing accounts
error individually with a pointer to import the chart of accounts
first; re-uploads dedup.

### Sales receipts from a QuickBooks report CSV

QuickBooks Desktop can't export transactions to IIF, so the sales-
receipt migration doc pointed Desktop users at a Transaction Detail
report export — which previously had nowhere to land. It does now:
**QuickBooks Interop → Sales Receipts from Report CSV** imports a
"Transaction Detail by Date" export (filtered to Sales Receipt), each
receipt becoming a paid sale + payment with balanced journals.

Shaped by a real customer's export, so the parser handles what real
files contain: applied-deposit contra lines that reduce the total
(sign-aware — an absolute-value parse would inflate them), percentage
tax rows carrying the tax agency's name, deposits-only receipts,
thousands separators, and per-receipt balance checks with clear
errors. Unmatched account names post to default income with a warning;
re-uploads dedup by customer + date + total. Receipt numbers keep the
report's Num where free (SR-prefixed on collision).

### v2.6.1 — The receipt now looks like a receipt

- The printed/saved sales receipt was the unmodified invoice template —
  titled INVOICE, with Due Date, Terms, and Balance Due rows, saved as
  `Invoice_<n>.pdf`. It now renders as a SALES RECEIPT: date only, Sold
  To, Total + Paid (no balance line — nothing is due), filename
  `SalesReceipt_<n>.pdf`, and the same for the email attachment name.
  Found on macOS hardware by the build maintainer during the v2.6.0
  release pass. (#60)
- The PDF's Bill To / Sold To block always prints the customer's name
  now: the template fell back on a `customer_name` attribute only some
  callers stamped onto the invoice, so the direct PDF route printed a
  bare header whenever the customer had no address on file.
- `SHA256SUMS.macos` now also lists the stable-named
  `SlowBooksPro-macos-arm64.dmg`, so the README's direct download can be
  checksum-verified, not just the versioned asset.

### v2.6.0 — Sales receipts: one-screen POS sales + QuickBooks import

For businesses that ring up sales at a counter instead of invoicing:
a QuickBooks sales receipt is an invoice paid at the moment of sale,
and SlowBooks now models it exactly that way — an Invoice flagged
`is_sales_receipt` plus a Payment for the full total, so every
existing report, PDF, export, and void path works unchanged. Schema
migration `c7d8e9f0a1b2` adds the flag (drop-in; new databases need
nothing).

- **Enter Sales Receipts screen** — new sidebar page with a
  one-screen form: customer (with quick-add), payment method,
  check #/reference, deposit-to account (defaults to Undeposited
  Funds), tax, class, currency, and line items. `POST
  /api/sales-receipts` composes the existing invoice and payment
  routes, so numbering, closing-date enforcement, FX, and
  inventory/COGS behave identically to documents entered separately;
  if the payment half fails the invoice half is voided rather than
  left as a stray open balance. Receipts list on their own page and
  no longer clutter the Invoices list (`GET
  /api/invoices?is_sales_receipt=...` filters either way; omitting
  the param returns everything, as before).
- **IIF import: `CASH SALE` blocks** — QuickBooks Desktop's sales
  receipts previously fell into the silently-skipped bucket. They now
  import as paid invoice + payment with balanced journals (deposit
  account from the TRNS header, Undeposited Funds fallback).
  Counter sales with a blank Customer:Job land on an auto-created
  "Walk-In Customer" (reported as a warning); unnumbered receipts get
  the next invoice number, and re-imports dedup by document number or
  customer + date + total.
- **QBO import: SalesReceipt entity** — the QuickBooks Online
  importer pulls sales receipts alongside invoices and payments, with
  the same id-mapping dedup; the QBO page gets a Sales Receipts
  import checkbox (import-only — there is no matching export entity).
- **docs/migrate-from-quickbooks.md** — new guide covering both
  paths, including the fact that Desktop's built-in IIF export is
  lists-only and the clean Transaction Detail report recipe for
  getting sales history out.

### v2.5.3 — API hardening, from a full-surface sweep

Every one of the API's 357 operations was driven end-to-end on Windows
(installer) and Linux (source, PostgreSQL 17); everything that surfaced is
fixed here. No schema migrations; drop-in upgrade from 2.5.x.

**Data-integrity fixes**

- An invalid `pay_type` or `role` on an employee was written as-is and then
  made the row permanently unreadable — one bad `PUT` returned 500 for the
  record *and* for `GET /api/employees` company-wide, with no API-level
  recovery. Both fields are now validated as enums (422 at the edge), the
  same treatment `pay_frequency` and `filing_status` already had. For rows
  corrupted before the fix, `scripts/repair_employee_enums.py` repairs in
  raw SQL (dry-run by default; `--apply` to write).
- The migration dry-run tolerated a one-cent journal imbalance the importer
  then refused, so `ok=true` could precede a mid-import 500. The gate now
  applies the importer's exact-balance rule, including to synthesized
  opening-balance journals.
- Customer and vendor names: blank/whitespace-only names rejected, lengths
  capped to the column width (was: opaque 500 on PostgreSQL, silent
  overflow on SQLite), obviously malformed emails rejected. The CSV and
  IIF importers honor the same rules — an IIF transaction with a blank
  NAME no longer auto-creates an unnamed customer.

**Correctness / API behavior**

- Emailing an invoice (and Settings → "send test email") called
  `send_email()` with a stale signature and could never succeed; both now
  work, report 502 with a pointer to the email log when SMTP fails, and no
  longer double-log.
- Account endpoints return 409 with a real message instead of leaking
  database errors as 500s (delete-with-history, duplicate account number);
  an account can no longer be made its own parent.
- `/openapi.json` no longer requires auth, so the documented agent flow
  ("discover from the spec") works; the spec now declares its bearer
  security scheme, with genuinely public routes exempted.
- API tokens can no longer clear or roll back the closing date, nor set
  the closing-date override password; moving the date forward (tightening)
  is still allowed, and signed-in users are unaffected.
- Machine-originated audit rows (e.g. the token `last_used_at` stamp) are
  attributed to an explicit `system` principal instead of NULL.
- `SlowBooksPro.exe --help` with piped/redirected output hung the frozen
  Windows build forever on an invisible error dialog (UnicodeEncodeError
  under cp1252 inside argparse). Launcher stdio is now total; verified on
  Windows before/after.

**Docs**

- INSTALL.md's native Linux path works as written on PEP 668 distros
  (venv steps, `.env` honored by alembic, APP_DEBUG guidance);
  `.env.example` no longer recommends a FORCE_HTTPS setting the app
  refuses to boot with; README operation count corrected.

**Report display fix**

- Balance-sheet and P&L lines rendered in the app wrapped every amount in
  an absolute value, so a contra-balance account displayed positive while
  the totals summed real signed values — visibly "$100 + $400 + $600 =
  $300" after an unapplied customer payment drove A/R negative (a
  legitimate prepayment). Lines now render signed, matching the totals
  and the PDF output, which were always correct. (#56)

**macOS releases now sign themselves in CI**

- Tag builds sign, notarize, and staple the macOS DMG on the runner using
  the same release tooling the maintainer ran locally, and attach it to
  the release alongside the Windows assets. Starting with this release the
  macOS publisher identity is **Trenton Von Holten** (previously releases
  were signed by the macOS maintainer's own Developer ID).

20 new regression tests (1162 total).

### Native macOS desktop

- Added a signed and Apple-notarized native app for Apple Silicon Macs running
  macOS 14 or newer, distributed as a drag-to-Applications DMG.
- Desktop companies, settings keys, uploads, logs, and backups persist under
  the user's Application Support directory; upgrades never place writable data
  inside the app bundle.
- Bundled PDF libraries and the Cocoa window backend are exercised before a
  build can become a release candidate.

### v2.3.0 — Migration onramps

**Migrate Data** — one page that brings accounting history in from six
systems, each behind the same dry-run-gated engine (nothing is written
until every reconstructed journal balances and, when supplied, the
trial balance reconciles):

- **MYOB** — fully validated against MYOB's own Clearwater sample
  company (101 accounts, 328 journals, ledger balanced to the cent,
  every account reconciling exactly to MYOB's trial balance). Handles
  tab-separated classic exports, dd/mm/yyyy dates, header accounts,
  reused journal IDs, number-only GL rows, duplicate account names,
  and per-type journal file bundles. docs/migrate-from-myob.md walks
  the export flow.
- **GnuCash** — fully validated against real 5.5 exports (multi-split
  transactions, GUID grouping, signed per-split amounts, placeholder
  accounts).
- **Xero** — refactored onto the shared engine (behavior-identical).
- **Zoho Books** — chart validated against a live account's export.
- **Wave** — trial-balance report shape validated against a live
  account's export; supports both debit/credit and signed
  single-amount transaction exports.
- **Sage 50** — account-ID resolution, mm/dd dates, Sage's descriptive
  account types.
- Opening balances: trial-balance residuals that net to zero (the
  source system's account-setup balances, absent from any journal
  export) are detected and imported as one balanced opening journal.

**Dependencies** — refreshed across the board for the release
(FastAPI 0.141, Stripe SDK 15, cryptography 50, argon2-cffi 25,
python-multipart 0.0.32, psycopg2-binary 2.9.12); pip-audit clean.
The route-table introspection tests were taught FastAPI 0.141's new
nested-router shape, with a tripwire so a future shape change can
never silently empty the auth-contract suite again.

### v2.2.0 — The fork-integration release

The largest single release since 2.0: work mined from four community
forks (with per-commit attribution), two new payment processors, and
five major accounting features.

**Online payments — Stripe, PayPal, Square**
- Payment-provider abstraction with one shared, idempotent recorder
  (row-locked; a webhook and a status poll can never double-record).
- PayPal (Checkout Orders v2) and Square (Payment Links) join Stripe;
  enable any combination and the pay page shows a button per processor.
- Desktop installs record payments without webhooks: verified capture
  on the customer's return + a "Check Payment Status" button.
- Fixed: the public Pay button 401'd (checkout route was never
  session-exempt) and the success banner trusted a URL query param —
  it now renders only after provider-verified capture.
- Fixed (found in live sandbox testing): Square leaves paid
  payment-link orders in state OPEN; polling now recognizes them.

**Class tracking**
- QuickBooks-style class dimension on invoices, bills, estimates,
  credit memos, recurring, journals, deposits, and cc charges;
  managed in Settings; immutable "Uncategorized" system default.
- P&L by Class report whose totals reconcile exactly with the plain
  P&L; IIF SPL.CLASS resolves on import.

**Multi-currency**
- Foreign-currency invoices and bills booked at per-document rates
  (Bank of Canada feed prefill, always overridable); the ledger stays
  single-currency so every report and invariant holds exactly.
- Realized FX gain/loss posts automatically on BOTH sides: customer
  payments (A/R) and bill payments (A/P).
- Cross-currency allocations rejected with clear errors; online
  checkout guarded to home-currency invoices.

**Fixed assets**
- Register with per-type account mappings, straight-line and
  declining-balance depreciation runs (one journal per asset, salvage
  floor, idempotent re-runs), disposal with gain/loss, CSV import,
  and a reconciliation report.

**Migration onramps**
- Xero CSV import (chart + general ledger + trial balance) gated by a
  dry-run that verifies every journal balances and cross-checks the
  trial balance before anything is written.
- Opening Balances wizard: guided setup, normal-side posting rules,
  optional auto-balance to equity.

**Banking & interop**
- Bank CSV import for Chase checking/credit and PayPal exports,
  auto-detected by header signature, with content-derived dedup that
  survives re-imports without dropping legitimate same-day duplicates.
- IIF BILL and DEPOSIT transaction blocks (previously silently
  discarded), with strict vendor/account matching and
  duplicates-skipped reporting.

**Reports**
- Printable P&L and Balance Sheet PDFs plus the one-click Financial
  Statements Pack (P&L + Balance Sheet + Trial Balance, page-numbered),
  US Letter or A4 via a new setting.

**Hardening**
- Auth-contract regression suite: every API route proven to 401
  unauthenticated or match a justified-public pattern (295 combos).
- Upload size caps on all import endpoints; CREATE DATABASE identifier
  quoting; decompilation debug strings scrubbed from the DOM with a
  regression scan; version-stable ruff lint gate.

**Community**
Work in this release originates from the forks of Alex Jordan
(@LayoverLogic), Joel Macklow (@joelmacklow), @moshgrossman, and
@amazon1148 — authorship preserved per commit. Thank you.

### v2.1.1 — Windows field fixes (first-machine feedback)

- **Session cookie now reaches every native window and download.**
  pywebview's default `private_mode=True` partitions WebView2 cookie
  storage, so the print-preview/PDF window opened as
  `{"detail":"Not authenticated"}` and CSV/backup downloads failed with
  "Needs authorization" (saving the 401 JSON body as `.json`). The
  desktop shell now uses a persistent shared profile under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlowBooksPro\data\webview` — PDFs, exports, and
  attachment downloads work, and logins survive app restarts.
- **The installer now installs the WebView2 runtime when missing**
  (silent Evergreen bootstrapper, skipped if already present) instead
  of showing a "runtime is not installed" error on first launch —
  Windows 10 machines without Edge updates hit this.

### Native Windows desktop install (no Docker, no WSL2)

Replaces the WSL2/Docker-Engine Windows setup from PR #1 with a fully
native install: the app runs as a normal Windows process against SQLite,
in its own desktop window (pywebview → WebView2). Desktop-mode groundwork
contributed in PR #14; delivery is a signed Windows installer (see below).

- **Multi-company, QuickBooks-style:** each company is its own SQLite file
  under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlowBooksPro\data\companies\`, tracked in a
  `companies.json` manifest. A company picker appears at every launch;
  switching companies = close and reopen. Creating a company runs the real
  `alembic upgrade head` plus the Chart of Accounts seed against a fresh
  file. Company identity/settings already live per-database, so each file
  is fully self-contained.
- **Backups on SQLite:** `backup_service` gains a SQLite branch — backup/
  restore are consistent `.db` snapshots via sqlite3's online backup API.
  Postgres installs keep pg_dump/pg_restore unchanged.
- **Migrations now genuinely run on SQLite:** four ALTER-added FK
  constraints converted to Alembic batch mode and literal `now()` server
  defaults replaced with the dialect-portable `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
  (identical semantics on PostgreSQL; these migrations have already run on
  existing Postgres installs and never re-run).
- **Launcher:** `desktop_launcher.py` — env prep with a generated
  `PAYROLL_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`, company picker, uvicorn on 127.0.0.1,
  native window; closing the window stops the server.
- **Delivery is a signed installer**, not setup scripts: the
  `.bat`/`.ps1` bootstrap flow contributed in PR #14 was replaced by
  `SlowBooksPro-Setup-x64.exe` — a PyInstaller bundle (Python and the
  PDF-rendering libraries included, nothing installed system-wide) built
  by CI and code-signed via Azure Trusted Signing, so Windows shows a
  verified publisher instead of a SmartScreen warning.
- The Docker/Postgres multi-company path (separate databases per company)
  is unchanged and still used when `DATABASE_URL` is Postgres.

### Post-merge review fixes (PR #12 follow-up)

A deep review pass after merging the payroll/HR contribution surfaced and
fixed twelve issues plus a round of structural cleanups (commits `af65843`,
`68eb844`).

**Schema / migrations:**

- Six `Employee` columns (`portal_token_last_used`, `portal_token_expires_at`,
  `everify_status`, `everify_submitted_at`, `everify_closed_at`,
  `everify_notes`) and four whole tables (`document_audits`, `login_attempts`,
  `reseller_permits`, `portal_accesses`) existed only in the models — no
  Alembic migration created them. Startup `create_all()` masked the missing
  tables but never ALTERs the existing `employees` table, so employee
  creation, portal access, and E-Verify updates crashed with
  `UndefinedColumn` on any alembic-migrated PostgreSQL.
  `migrations/versions/d0e1f2a3b4c5` adds the columns;
  `migrations/versions/bc3c3c5fd0a6` adds the tables (existence-guarded so it
  works on databases where `create_all` already made them). Verified with a
  full model-vs-schema diff against a scratch Postgres — zero gaps remain.

**Correctness:**

- `app/services/iif_export.py` — payment export filtered with
  `.filter(not Payment.is_voided)`, which Python evaluates to
  `.filter(False)` at query-build time (`WHERE false`), so payment IIF
  exports were always empty. Restored the column comparison.
- `app/routes/invoices.py` — late fees were being applied to DRAFT (unsent)
  invoices: drafts get a terms-derived `due_date` at creation, so they
  qualified as overdue. Filter scoped back to SENT/PARTIAL. Fee rounding
  switched from bare `.quantize()` (banker's rounding) to `_q`
  (ROUND_HALF_UP) to match the rest of the ledger.
- `app/routes/bills.py` — `void_bill` gained the payments-applied guard that
  `void_invoice` already had: voiding a paid bill reversed the full A/P while
  the bill payment's cash JE and allocations stayed on the books,
  double-counting the outflow.
- `app/services/nacha_export.py` — `_split_net_pay` silently dropped
  unallocated net pay when an employee had only PERCENT/FIXED accounts and no
  REMAINDER/FULL account, producing an ACH file that underpaid the employee
  with no error. Now raises `ValueError` (the route maps it to 400).
- `app/services/payroll_service.py` + `app/routes/payroll.py` — the
  $1M/37% supplemental-withholding tier could never fire:
  `supplemental_federal_tax()` implements it but the call site never passed
  `ytd_supplemental`. YTD bonus-run wages are now threaded through
  (`_ytd_supplemental` helper; flat and gross-up paths). Deduction/gross/net
  rounding in the pay-run route unified on `_q` — bare `.quantize(CENT)`
  rounded half-cents the opposite direction from the service.
- `app/static/js/employees.js` + `app/schemas/payroll.py` — the pay-frequency
  dropdown emitted `semimonthly` but the enum value is `semi_monthly`, so
  semi-monthly employees 500'd at flush. JS fixed; `pay_frequency` /
  `filing_status` now typed against the model enums so bad values 422 at the
  edge. Dropped the stale pre-2020 W-4 `allowances` field from the form.
- `app/routes/credit_memos.py` + `app/services/recurring_service.py` — the
  MAX+1 numbering race fix invoices got (retry on `IntegrityError` against
  the UNIQUE constraint) now also covers credit memos and the recurring
  batch. The recurring path retries under a SAVEPOINT so one collision can't
  abort the whole batch; a template that can't get a number is left for the
  next run.
- `app/services/accounting.py` — closing-date enforcement moved inside
  `create_journal_entry()` so every entry point inherits it. Recurring runs,
  IIF/QBO imports, and inventory hooks could previously post into closed
  periods that the UI forbids. Route-level checks kept for earlier, clearer
  errors; `bypass_closing_date` kwarg exists as an operator escape hatch but
  nothing sets it.
- `app/routes/portal.py` — the token-in-URL POST handlers (W-4 elections,
  direct-deposit accounts, PTO requests) resolved the employee without
  writing a `portal_accesses` audit row, while their cookie-based twins
  logged everything. All portal mutations are now audited.
- `app/routes/payroll.py` — the JSON tax-form endpoints (`/forms/w2|w3|940|941`)
  hand-rolled box math that diverged from the PDF path — W-2 box 3 returned
  raw gross with no Social Security wage-base cap. They now delegate to the
  same `compute_w2/w3/940/941` services the PDFs use; the 941 also now counts
  only PROCESSED stubs.

**Hardening / cleanup:**

- ABA check-digit validation (`validate_routing_number`, weights 3-7-1) for
  direct-deposit routing numbers — used by the portal and the employees API;
  previously both accepted any 9 digits, so a typo'd routing number wasn't
  caught until the bank bounced the ACH file.
- `_q`/`CENT` money rounding consolidated onto `app/services/accounting.py`
  (was copy-pasted across ~17 service modules; one divergent copy in
  `inventory_service.py` kept deliberately — it quantizes quantities/costs to
  4 dp).
- Portal token/cookie handler bodies deduped into shared `_save_profile` /
  `_add_bank` / `_request_pto` helpers; `_client_ip` moved to
  `app/services/request_utils.py` (was duplicated in `auth.py` and
  `portal.py`).
- N+1 query fixes: time-entries list + pay-period summary, PTO requests
  list, pay-run deduction loading, and W-2/W-3 generation (one stub fetch
  for the whole year, bucketed in memory, instead of 2+ queries per
  employee).

**Test coverage:**

- `tests/test_closing_date_enforcement.py` — four new service-layer tests
  including the recurring-service path.
- `tests/test_no_nplus1_in_list_endpoints.py` — extended to time-entries and
  PTO list endpoints.
- Routing-number fixtures updated to ABA-valid values (`021000021`).
- Full suite: 458 passed; black/ruff clean.

### AP void — `POST /api/bill-payments/{id}/void`

The customer-payment void (`POST /api/payments/{id}/void`) had no AP mirror.
Any voided customer receipt restored A/R cleanly; vendor bill payments could
not be undone at all. This gap is now closed.

**What was added:**

- `app/routes/bill_payments.py` — `void_bill_payment()` endpoint. Acquires a
  `with_for_update()` row-lock on the payment before checking `is_voided`,
  so two concurrent void requests cannot both pass the guard and post
  duplicate reversing JEs. Posts a reversing JE (swaps debit/credit on every
  original JE line). Walks each `BillPaymentAllocation` with a second
  `with_for_update()` lock and restores `amount_paid` / `balance_due` /
  `status` on each bill. Respects the closing-date guard — cannot post a
  reversing JE into a locked period.

- `app/models/bills.py` — `is_voided = Column(Boolean, …)` on `BillPayment`.

- `app/schemas/bills.py` — `is_voided: bool = False` on `BillPaymentResponse`.

- `migrations/versions/c9d0e1f2a3b4_add_is_voided_to_bill_payments.py` —
  Alembic migration adds the column with `server_default=false()`.

- `app/static/js/bills.js` — `BillsPage.voidBillPayment()` wires the new
  endpoint to the UI so the wiring audit passes.

**Test coverage:**

- `tests/test_void_reversal_symmetry.py::test_bill_payment_void_restores_bill_balance`
  — full void cycle: bill paid → void → balance restored, ledger balanced,
  double-void rejects 400.
- `tests/test_closing_date_enforcement.py::test_bill_payment_void_respects_closing_date`
  — reversing JE cannot land in a closed period.

---

### Whole-repo lint & format sweep

`black 24.8` and `ruff 0.6` run against `app/ tests/ scripts/` without an
allowlist — every file is now clean. CI replaced a 30-line per-file allowlist
with a two-line whole-tree gate.

Fixes applied to reach a clean tree:

- **E402** (imports not at top of file) in `app/routes/invoices.py`,
  `app/routes/stripe_payments.py`, `app/routes/reports.py`,
  `app/routes/saved_reports.py`, `app/services/iif_import.py`.
- **E741** (ambiguous `l` variable name) in `app/services/accounting.py`,
  `app/routes/journal.py`, `app/routes/reports.py`,
  `app/services/iif_import.py`, `app/services/tax_export.py`,
  `scripts/repair_rounding_drift.py`.
- **black reformatting** of ~40 files with over-long lines.

---

### Books-balance invariant tests (`test_books_balance_invariants.py`)

Seven cross-feature invariant tests that exercise the entire accounting layer
end-to-end through the API:

1. Every posted JE has `Σ debit == Σ credit`.
2. Full ledger `Σ debit == Σ credit` across all transactions.
3. Balance sheet balances: `A == L + E` (with synthetic Net Income line).
4. A/R aging total matches open invoice balances.
5. A/P aging total matches open bill balances.
6. Analytics A/R widget matches `/api/reports/ar-aging`.
7. P&L net income matches the balance-sheet synthetic equity line.

`_build_scenario()` creates a realistic dataset (3 invoices, 2 bills,
payments at various states) before each invariant check.

---

### Shell-injection AST audit (`test_subprocess_safety_audit.py`)

Four CI-gated static-analysis tests that verify the subprocess/shell call
surface is safe:

1. Zero `subprocess.*` calls in `app/` or `scripts/` use `shell=True`.
2. Zero `os.system` / `os.popen` / `commands.getoutput` in production code.
3. All three subprocess callsites use list-form args (not string
   interpolation).
4. Every bash script in `scripts/` double-quotes all `$VAR` expansions.

Uses `ast.NodeVisitor` for Python files; regex for shell scripts. Runs in
< 1 s. Result: zero vulnerabilities found in the codebase.

---

### Void-reversal symmetry tests (`test_void_reversal_symmetry.py`)

Six property-based invariant tests for void semantics:

1. Full payment void restores invoice balance and keeps ledger balanced.
2. Partial payment void restores only the voided portion.
3. Bill-payment void restores bill balance, keeps ledger balanced, double-void
   rejects 400.
4. Invoice void (no payments applied) → status VOID, balance\_due 0, ledger
   balanced.
5. Invoice void with payments applied rejects 400/409 (would double-reverse
   A/R).
6. Double-void of same payment rejects or is a no-op — never posts a second
   reversing JE.

---

### Closing-date exhaustive sweep (extended `test_closing_date_enforcement.py`)

Expanded from 3 to 13 tests. Added `test_bill_payment_void_respects_closing_date`
(the AP void guard), plus nine exhaustive sweep tests covering every
direct-create route that accepts a user-supplied date and posts a JE:
invoices, bills, payments, bill-payments, credit memos, journal entries,
CC charges, deposits, batch payments.

---

### IIF round-trip tests (`test_iif_round_trip.py`)

Three tests verifying the Intuit Interchange Format export/import pipeline:

1. Chart-of-accounts export → reimport preserves all accounts by number.
2. Customer names with metacharacters (`\t`, `\n`) are sanitized on export;
   the sanitized record can be reimported cleanly.
3. Invoice TRNS + SPL rows sum to zero (double-entry identity): the A/R debit
   plus income credits plus tax credit == 0.

---

### Production-readiness sweep (rounding / races / N+1 / closing-date / secrets)

A 19-commit program-wide audit of every JE-posting path and money
boundary in the codebase. All 452 tests pass; live walkthrough
exercised every flow listed below.

**Money math — rounding drift fixed at the source.**
The class of bugs: `qty * rate` was stored to `Numeric(12, 2)` columns
without being quantized first. SQL rounded each line on the way in,
so `sum(line.amount)` no longer equaled the stored `subtotal` after a
round-trip. Fix: every per-line money expression now goes through
`_q()` (ROUND_HALF_UP at 2 decimals) **before** being assigned. Applied
to invoices, bills, POs, estimates, credit memos, and the recurring
invoice generator. `compute_line_totals()` is the single canonical
helper. `scripts/repair_rounding_drift.py` detects and repairs
pre-fix rows (dry-run by default; `--apply` writes).

**Auto-number races — IntegrityError retry on every doc series.**
`SELECT MAX(num) + 1` followed by `INSERT` has no lock. Two concurrent
creates would both see the same MAX and collide on the UNIQUE
constraint. `create_invoice`, `create_po`, and `create_estimate` now
catch `IntegrityError`, roll back, and retry up to 10 times. Pinned
by `tests/test_invoice_number_race.py`.

**N+1 SELECT storm — eager-loaded every list endpoint.**
`for inv in invoices: inv.customer.name` was firing one SELECT per
row. Added `joinedload(.customer)` + `selectinload(.lines)` to
invoices, bills, POs, estimates, payments. Also clamped `skip`/`limit`
on every list route (1 ≤ limit ≤ 1000; skip ≥ 0). Pinned by
`tests/test_no_nplus1_in_list_endpoints.py`.

**Closing-date enforcement — plugged three bypass paths.**
A code audit found three routes that posted dated JEs without calling
`check_closing_date`:
- `POST /api/purchase-orders/{id}/convert-to-bill`
- `POST /api/estimates/{id}/convert`
- `POST /api/payroll/{id}/process`

Each one let an operator land a JE into a closed period by routing
through a "convert" or "process" verb instead of the direct create.
All three now call the guard. Pinned by
`tests/test_closing_date_enforcement.py`.

**Stripe webhook idempotency under contention.**
Stripe retries with backoff; two webhook deliveries can land
milliseconds apart. The check-then-insert against `Payment.reference`
let both pass the existence guard and create duplicate payments. Fix:
`with_for_update()` on the invoice row before the idempotency check,
so the second arrival serializes behind the first and sees the
already-recorded payment.

**Settings — secret redaction on GET.**
`GET /api/settings` was returning `stripe_secret_key`,
`smtp_password`, `closing_date_password`, and the QBO tokens in
plaintext. Fix: response runs through `_redact_secrets()`, which
replaces any non-empty secret with `"********"`. `PUT` treats the
placeholder as a no-op so a UI round-trip can't overwrite the real
value with `"********"`. Pinned by `tests/test_settings_redaction.py`.

**Input validation at the boundary.**
Schema-level rejection of impossible inputs: zero-line invoices /
bills / POs / estimates (422), negative quantity / rate / hours (422),
zero or negative payment amounts (400), payment allocations exceeding
invoice balance (400), duplicate `(vendor_id, bill_number)` pairs
(409). 17 tests in `tests/test_input_validation.py`.

**Payment void race.**
`void_payment` walked allocations and decremented `invoice.balance_due`
without locking. Concurrent voids could double-credit. Fix:
`with_for_update()` on both the payment and each invoice in the
allocation loop.

**Reconciliation drift.**
`sum(float(t.amount) ...)` over hundreds of cleared transactions
produced sub-cent float drift that made a truly-zero difference
display as `$0.00000001`. Replaced with `Decimal(str(...))`
arithmetic; convert to float only at the JSON boundary.

**Analytics AR aging consistency.**
The dashboard widget bucketed by **days-since-invoiced**; the
`/api/reports/ar-aging` endpoint bucketed by **days-past-due**. Same
data, different bucket → operator confusion. Analytics now matches
the report.

**Balance sheet — synthetic Net Income equity line.**
With no equity accounts holding transactions, the balance sheet
showed `Total Equity = 0` even though the books balanced. Now
computes net income from income/COGS/expense accounts and appends a
synthetic "Net Income (current period)" line to equity. A − L − E = 0.

**AR aging filter — include DRAFT.**
Aging was filtering `[SENT, PARTIAL]` only, hiding draft invoices with
open balances. Now `[DRAFT, SENT, PARTIAL]` at all 10 filter sites.

**Schema response types — Decimal not float.**
`BillResponse`, `BillLineResponse`, `POResponse`, `CreditMemoResponse`
were serializing money as `float`. Now `Decimal`. Round-trip stays
exact through the wire.

**Error handling — 4xx / 5xx mapping.**
`get_1099_pdf` was 500ing on a `ValueError` (not-found case); now
404. `restore_backup` always returned 500 regardless of cause; now
maps to 400 / 404 / 500. `low_stock_items` now surfaces oversold
inventory (`qty < 0`) regardless of reorder_point.

**IIF export — tab/newline sanitization.**
A vendor name with a `\t` in it would split that field into two on
import elsewhere. `_iif_clean()` now strips `\t\r\n` from every
field value before emission.

**Payroll input validation.**
`PayStubInput` schema rejects negative hours / overtime / deductions
/ gross_override at the boundary.

**IIF import — quantize SPL amounts.**
`_import_invoice` and `_import_estimate` now `_q(abs(...))` each SPL
amount before accumulating, matching the rounding semantics of
native invoice creation.

**Decompressed inventory restore audit, SSRF hardening, proxy
correctness** (batch 3 of the earlier enterprise eval) — see commits
`749b96e`, `f0c5816`, `87c0222`.

### Red-team pass on WC3D's Jinja2 XSS fix
WC3D's commit `ca6182f` enabled `autoescape=True` on the two Jinja2
Environments he found (`app/routes/public.py`,
`app/services/pdf_service.py`). A red-team sweep of every other
Jinja2 construction in `app/` turned up **one more spot** missing
the same fix:

- `app/services/email_service.py:139` — `SandboxedEnvironment()`
  (used to render admin-editable email templates with customer-
  supplied data injected as context). Fixed:
  `SandboxedEnvironment(autoescape=True)`.

- Same file, line 156–164 — when the file-based template fails, the
  fallback path was f-string-interpolating `invoice.customer.name`
  directly into an HTML body. Routed through `html.escape()` now.

Added `tests/test_jinja_autoescape_audit.py` — walks every
`Environment(...)` / `SandboxedEnvironment(...)` call in `app/`
(with a proper balanced-paren walker, since `Environment(loader=
FileSystemLoader(...))` defeats a naive `[^)]*` regex) and fails CI
if any one is missing `autoescape=`. The rule can't drift back.

Also verified the JS side: `toast()` uses `textContent`, so all
`toast(\`...${user.name}...\`)` calls are safe by construction;
`openModal()` uses `textContent` for the title (safe) and
`innerHTML` for the body (relies on per-call `escapeHtml()`, which
36 of 40 JS files use — the remainder don't render user-strings).
The broader JS-innerHTML-XSS class is a separate concern already
tracked under the CSP-unsafe-inline-cleanup item in `docs/todo.md`.

### Layout: `alembic/` → `migrations/`
Database migration scripts moved from `alembic/` to the more
conventional `migrations/` at the top level. `script_location` in
`alembic.ini` updated; references in CONTRIBUTING, PR template, and
docs all retargeted. The `alembic` CLI command itself is unchanged
(reads alembic.ini for its script_location), so `alembic upgrade
head` in `docker-entrypoint.sh` keeps working. Git tracked the moves
as renames, so blame history is preserved.

### Schema-wide date-collision fix (the rest of jake-378's pattern)
jake-378 previously fixed the `date: date` field-name-shadows-type
collision in `app/schemas/invoices.py` and `estimates.py` (commits
48cdb79, e12bbb1). A quick reproducer confirmed **pydantic 2.13 still
has the same bug**:

```python
class Update(BaseModel):
    date: Optional[date] = None   # Optional[<the field>] not Optional[date]
                                   # -> "Input should be None" on every value
```

Same pattern existed in **9 more schemas** (banking, bills, cc_charges,
credit_memos, deposits, journal, payments, purchase_orders,
time_entries) — applied jake's `from datetime import date as dt_date`
rename uniformly across all of them. Added
`tests/test_schemas_audit.py` to lock in the rule so the bug can't
drift back in via a new schema file. (296 tests now passing, up from
295.)

### PostgreSQL version doc alignment
Compose files (both dev and prod) already ship `postgres:17-alpine`,
but `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `docs/development.md`, and
`docs/operations.md` all said "PostgreSQL 16" or `brew install
postgresql@16`. Same lag-vs-reality pattern as the Python version
fix. Docs now match what's actually deployed (17).

### Dependency upgrade pass
Five hard-pinned (`==`) deps in `requirements.txt` were months behind.
Pins relaxed to floor-and-cap ranges so future patch/minor bumps land
without needing a release. All upgrades are stable 2.x → 2.x or
patch-only; no API churn expected. pip-audit on the new requirements
remains clean (zero known CVEs).

| Dep | Was | Now | Installed (verified) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alembic` | `==1.13.3` | `>=1.16.0,<2.0` | 1.18.4 |
| `sqlalchemy` | `==2.0.35` | `>=2.0.40,<3.0` | 2.0.49 |
| `pydantic` | `==2.9.2` | `>=2.11.0,<3.0` | 2.13.4 |
| `pydantic-settings` | `==2.5.2` | `>=2.10.0,<3.0` | 2.14.1 |
| `uvicorn[standard]` | `==0.30.6` | `>=0.32.0,<1.0` | 0.47.0 |

Tests: 295 passing on the upgraded set (no source changes needed).

### Python version doc alignment
`README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, and `docs/development.md` all said "Python
3.12" or "3.12+", but the Dockerfile, every CI job, and the CVE
comments in `requirements.txt` reference Python 3.13. Docs now say
3.13 (the actual tested version); INSTALL.md notes that 3.12 may work
but isn't gated by CI.

### CRM-side UX additions
- **Customer Details modal** — clicking a customer row now opens a
  single-screen popout (no sub-tabs) with billing/shipping addresses,
  autosaving notes, attached reseller permits, recent invoices, and
  recent payments. Closes the "where do we put notes for everyone to
  see?" gap.
- **Reseller permits module** — new `#/reseller-permits` page with
  expiring-soon strip, per-state format validation (WA 9-digit, CA
  9-12, TX 11), copy-permit/business-name/tax-ID buttons, and a
  unified Verify workflow that opens the state's official lookup site
  in the default browser (`window.open('_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer')`
  after a confirm dialog) then stamps `last_verified_at` / disables
  with an inactive marker. Backend has CRUD + `/expiring` +
  `/validate-format` + `/mark-verified`. Pure record-keeping — there
  is no fake "API call" to the state; the operator does the lookup,
  we record the verification trail.
- **Admin Sign Out button** — topbar now has a dedicated logout button
  that POSTs `/api/auth/logout` and reloads to the splash page. The
  endpoint was live; only the button was missing.

### Test infrastructure
- **Bidirectional wiring audit** — `tests/test_wiring.py` already
  asserted every JS `API.*` call resolves to a route; it now also
  asserts every backend `/api/*` route has a JS caller (or is on the
  `_INTENTIONAL_BACKEND_ONLY` allowlist). The catch-all collector
  picks up template-literal paths (including paths assigned to a
  variable before `API.post(url, …)`), `href=`/`action=` attributes
  in JS-rendered HTML, and `window.open('/api/…')`. Pre-substitutes
  `${…}` blocks before regex matching so nested `encodeURIComponent`
  expressions don't break the path capture. Each allowlist entry now
  carries a comment explaining *why* the route has no SPA caller
  (admin-only, scheduled job, drill-down endpoint shadowed by the
  bundled `/dashboard` response, future UI tab, etc.).
- **Audit hook coverage in tests** — `conftest.py` was creating a
  fresh per-test session factory but never re-attaching the
  `after_flush` audit hook to it, so the entire audit-log mechanism
  was silently bypassed in every existing test. The fixture now calls
  `register_audit_hooks` on the per-test session factory. A new
  matrix test (`test_audit_log_covers_new_entities_but_skips_audit_tables`)
  asserts a ResellerPermit insert lands in `audit_log` and a
  PortalAccess insert does NOT (it's already an audit-flavored table).
- **`_SKIP_TABLES` curated** — `audit_log` was the only entry; added
  `portal_accesses`, `login_attempts`, `document_audits`, and
  `email_log` (every one is itself an audit/log table, and double-
  logging into `audit_log` would just add noise and create a future
  recursion footgun if any of them ever gains a trigger-set `id`).

### Payroll / HR UI additions
- **Portal-token admin view** — Employee Details > Portal Access now
  shows expires-at (red when <30 days), last-used-at, and a
  collapsible recent-access log pulled from `portal_accesses`.
- **PTO accrual editor** — `#/hr/pto` gained an Employee Accruals
  section with enroll-employee-in-policy form and per-row "Run Accrual"
  prompt. Closes the gap where admins had to enroll employees via curl.
- **E-Verify case tracking** — schema additions (`everify_status`,
  `everify_submitted_at`, `everify_closed_at`, `everify_notes`),
  GET/PUT `/api/employees/{id}/everify` endpoints, and a new section
  in the Employee Details modal with color-coded status. Pure
  record-keeping — the federal E-Verify submission still happens via
  the official portal or a vendor; this stores the case so DHS
  inspections find it in one place.

### Partial CSP tightening
- index.html's 11 inline `onclick=`/`oninput=` handlers moved to a new
  `app/static/js/bootstrap.js` that wires them via `addEventListener`
  after DOMContentLoaded. The static shell page now has zero inline
  handlers — would work under a stricter CSP today.
- `'unsafe-inline'` stays in `script-src` and `style-src` because the
  JS-rendered modal templates across the rest of the app still emit
  inline handlers + styles. Removing those is a multi-file refactor
  documented in `docs/todo.md`. Honest accounting added to
  `docs/security-hardening.md`.

### Polish
- `docs/release-checklist.md` section 4 (TLS) now mentions optionally
  submitting the domain to the HSTS preload list once TLS is locked in.

### Audit + ops automation
- **Portal access audit log** — new `portal_accesses` table records
  every authenticated and unauthenticated portal hit (employee_id, IP,
  truncated UA, path, success). Mirrors `LoginAttempt` and gives
  forensic queries something more granular than `portal_token_last_used`.
- **Encryption key rewrap CLI** — `python -m app.services.encryption
  rewrap` re-encrypts every bank-PII blob under the current key, so
  rotation can actually complete (transparent reads via PREV fallback
  was already shipped). Supports `--dry-run`.
- **Wiring audit as a unit test** — `tests/test_wiring.py` grep-and-
  resolves every JS `API.*` call against the registered FastAPI routes.
  Catches typos and stale paths automatically — CI fails when a JS
  caller goes nowhere.
- **End-to-end portal test** — single test walks the entire portal
  lifecycle (mint → claim → 5 cookieless pages → POST PTO → logout →
  cold-401 → force-expire → rotate → claim again).
- **Weekly `pip-audit` GitHub Action** — Sunday cron, opens a
  security-labeled issue on findings (de-duped), fails the workflow run.

### Frontend polish
- **Drag-and-drop document uploads** on Employee Details > Documents.
- **Portal logout button** in `portal/base.html` nav.
- **Branded portal favicon** — `/portal/favicon.ico` serves the
  employer's company logo so each customer's portal carries their own
  bookmark icon.

### Bug fix
- Pay-stub PDF was rendering accountable-plan reimbursements as
  positive line items in the **Deductions** table. Now they have their
  own **Additions to Net (non-taxable)** table above net pay. Net-pay
  math was always right; the display was confusing.

### Tax forms — PDFs, audit hashes, the works
- **WeasyPrint PDF endpoints** — `POST /api/payroll/forms/{w2,w3,940,941}/.../pdf`
  render real printable forms (Acme Co. branded, masked SSN, full box
  data). The existing JSON endpoints stay for future e-file integration.
- **Document audit hashes** — every tax-form PDF carries a SHA-256
  content hash and an audit ID in the footer. Backed by a new
  `document_audits` table with three lookup endpoints
  (`/api/document-audits`, `.../verify/{hash}`, etc.). An auditor with
  the PDF can recompute the hash and confirm authenticity against
  the trust-anchor row.

### Payroll / HR
- **Time-entry → pay-run auto-population** — the pay-run form now has
  a "Use approved time entries" checkbox + live-preview column showing
  unpaid approved hours per employee. Backend was already wired; only
  the frontend opt-in was missing.
- **PTO year-end carryover automation** — new
  `POST /api/pto/accruals/year-end-carryover?target_year=YYYY` endpoint
  caps every accrual at its policy `max_carryover` and resets YTD
  counters, returning a per-row before/after summary.
- **Portal cookie session** — after the first `/portal/{token}` claim,
  the token moves into a `HttpOnly Secure SameSite=Strict` cookie and
  every subsequent URL is cookieless. No more Referer leak, browser
  history, or shared-bookmark exposure. Backward-compat: emailed
  `/portal/{token}` links still work — they just redirect through the
  claim flow once.
- **Portal branding** — every page renders the employer's company name
  and logo in the header (was generic "Employee Portal").
- **State new-hire report PDF branding** — same treatment.

### Authentication / session hardening
- **Login attempt audit log** — new `login_attempts` table records
  every success and failure (IP, UA, timestamp). Catches the slow
  brute-force attacker who paces under the 5/min rate limit.
- **Session rotation on login** — `request.session.clear()` before
  issuing the auth flag, defense-in-depth against session fixation.
- **Idle session timeout** — sliding window via
  `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 14400s = 4 hours). Sessions
  past the threshold get 401'd and cleared.

### Security
- **App-level `HTTPSRedirectMiddleware`** + HSTS (2-year, includeSubDomains,
  preload) when `FORCE_HTTPS=true`. Session cookie carries `Secure` flag
  in the same conditional.
- **Content-Security-Policy** — `frame-ancestors none`, `object-src
  none`, `form-action self`, Stripe origins allowlisted.
- **Startup fail-hard checks** (production only): refuses to start if
  `PAYROLL_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` is the dev default, `DATABASE_URL` lacks
  `sslmode`, or `FORCE_HTTPS=false`.
- **Portal token expiry** — 1-year hard + 90-day sliding idle. Expired
  tokens return `410 Gone`.
- **Portal headers** — `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and
  `Cache-Control: no-store` on every portal response.
- **Encryption key versioning** — bank PII ciphertext now prefixed with
  `v1:`. `PAYROLL_ENCRYPTION_SECRET_PREV` env var supports
  zero-downtime key rotation; decrypt tries current key first, then
  previous.
- **Per-endpoint rate limiting** — portal at 30/min GET / 10/min POST,
  joining the existing 5/min on login.

### Dependency CVE pass
Bumped requirements.txt to close known CVEs surfaced by `pip-audit`:
- `cryptography` — cap raised from `<44.0` to `<47.0`, floor `46.0.5`
  (closes PYSEC-2026-35, CVE-2024-12797, CVE-2026-26007, etc.)
- `fastapi` — bumped from `0.115.0` to `>=0.121.0,<0.122` to allow
  starlette `0.47+`
- New explicit `starlette>=0.47.2,<0.50` pin (closes CVE-2024-47874,
  CVE-2025-54121)
- New explicit `pyjwt>=2.10.0,<3.0` pin (override intuit-oauth's
  transitive 2.7.0 with known CVE)

`pip-audit -r requirements.txt` now reports **zero known
vulnerabilities**.

### Wiring fixes
Spider-web audit of every `API.*` call against every `@router.*`
handler caught four real breakages:
- 3× `API.delete()` typos (`API.del` is the actual export) — `employees.js`,
  `deductions.js`
- Missing `GET /api/pto/policies/{id}` and `PUT /api/pto/policies/{id}` —
  the policy-edit form was 404'ing
- `/approve` and `/reject` alias routes for the PTO `/decision` endpoint —
  the buttons were hitting non-existent paths

### Docs + repo conventions
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**, **`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`**,
  **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug_report,feature_request,config}.{md,yml}`** — the
  standard set this size of repo should have had.
- **`docs/hipaa-compliance.md`** — Security Rule mapping, 8-gap honest
  assessment, deployment recommendations.
- **`docs/security-hardening.md`** + **`docs/wiring-audit.md`** + **`docs/todo.md`** — engineering
  logs for the hardening pass, the wiring audit methodology, and the
  internal TODO scratchpad.
- README de-Phased / de-Tiered — that history now lives in this
  CHANGELOG file instead of cluttering the user-facing readme.

### Cleanup
- **Alembic revision collision fixed** — tier1 was sharing
  `f6a7b8c9d0e1` with the Phase 11 inventory migration. Renamed to
  `f7a8b9c0d1e2`; chain is now linear.
- `test_frontend_pages.py` moved from repo root to
  `scripts/integration_test_frontend.py` (it's a live-HTTP integration
  script, not a unit test).
- `app/templates/invoice_pdf_v2.html` deleted — added 5 weeks ago but
  never wired into `pdf_service.py`.
- `backups/` directory kept tracked (via `.gitkeep`) but contents
  gitignored so dumps don't accidentally land in commits.

### Test coverage
297 tests passing. Up from 119 at the start of this branch's work.
All previously-passing tests still pass.

### Docs reorganization
Root now keeps only `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (the conventional set). Everything
else moved into `docs/`.

## [2.0.0] — May 2026

### Added
- **Analytics dashboard** at `#/analytics` — KPI cards plus four charts
  (12-month revenue line, expenses doughnut, A/R+A/P stacked bar,
  90-day cash forecast), MTD/QTD/YTD period selector, CSV/PDF export
  with branded headers.
- **AI Insights** — Optional one-shot executive brief (3 observations /
  3 risks / 3 recommendations) with seven supported providers (xAI Grok,
  Groq, Cloudflare Workers AI, Cloudflare self-hosted gateway, Anthropic
  Claude, OpenAI, Google Gemini). Bring-your-own-key, encrypted at rest.
- **AI Predefined Analyses** — 11 curated actions across 5 categories,
  replacing the earlier free-form chat (more reliable across providers).
- **Inventory ledger** — Perpetual inventory with weighted-average cost,
  automatic COGS journal entries on every sale, reorder points,
  Adjust modal for add/remove/set-to-count.
- **Drill-down reports** — P&L and Balance Sheet rows are click-through
  to source transactions with running balance and source-doc links.
- **Saved Reports** — Name and one-click rerun favorite report configs.
- **Duplicate detection** — Fuzzy matching on customer/vendor names with
  a confirm-and-create-anyway dialog.
- **Setup wizard** collects operator name + email + company name + email
  + password (was password-only).
- **Branded headers** on PDF/CSV exports (SlowBooks Pro 2026 wordmark +
  company logo).

### Changed
- AI provider config moved from a modal to a Settings sub-page with a
  curated model dropdown and Custom escape hatch.
- Items form gained the full inventory toolset (track checkbox, qty,
  reorder point, asset account).
- Customers/Vendors gained the duplicate-warning confirm dialog.

### Security
- **Single-user authentication** — Argon2id-hashed password, session
  cookie (`same_site=strict`, 30-day TTL).
- **Rate limiting** — slowapi at 5 logins/minute per IP.
- **Security headers** — X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options DENY,
  Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy on all responses.
- **CORS lockdown** — explicit origin allowlist, no wildcards.
- **Path traversal protection** — backup and attachment endpoints use
  `Path.is_relative_to()`.
- **Atomic secret writes** — session key uses `mkstemp` + `os.replace()`.
- **Fernet encryption** for AI provider API keys.
- **SSRF protection** — AI provider URLs validated against private IPs
  and metadata endpoints.
- **Constant-time secret compare** in the Cloudflare Worker gateway.
- **Schema-validated AI config payloads.**
- **CSV formula injection protection** — exports neutralize `=`, `+`,
  `-`, `@` cell prefixes.
- **Non-root Docker** — container runs as UID 1000.

### Performance
- Analytics dashboard: 10 SQL queries, ~26 ms engine on 3,000 invoices
  plus 1,500 bills.
- Test suite runs in under 30 seconds with zero network dependencies.

### Fixed
- Dark mode now works on every report subtotal row (missing `--gray-50`
  definition).
- `--text-main` typo fixed.
